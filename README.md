### ZNC Install
```
znc_install_version: 1.6.1  # The version of znc to install

```

### ZNC Global Configuration
```
znc_max_buffer_size: 100000    # The max size of any user buffer.  This is used as the default if no user-specific value is given.
znc_host: 127.0.0.1            # What host address to use?
znc_port: 6666                 # What port will znc listen on?

znc_ipv6: false                # ipv6?
znc_ssl: true                  # Should ZNC expect connections over ssl?
znc_ssl_certfile: "{{ znc_config_root }}/znc.pem"   # If ssl is enabled, where is the PEM file? This is generated by the Ansible build.
znc_global_modules:                                 # Which global modules should be installed for use across all users and networks?  Note that these are separate from user and network modules defined below.

### ZNC User Definition Configuration
```
znc_users:                                # It's advisable to have a separate admin user with no networks, for administering the ZNC server directly.  Here we just have the one user, for brevity.
