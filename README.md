### ZNC Install
```
znc_install_version: 1.6.1  # The version of znc to install
znc_force_install: False    # Force a reinstallation of ZNC

znc_config_root: /etc/znc   # The root location of znc's configuration file structure
znc_exec_with_debug: false  # Should znc be executed in debug mode?  The logs will show up in /var/log/upstart/znc.log
```

### ZNC Global Configuration
```
znc_max_buffer_size: 100000    # The max size of any user buffer.  This is used as the default if no user-specific value is given.
znc_port: 6666                 # What port will znc listen on?
znc_ipv4: true                 # Should ZNC listen for ipv4 connections?
znc_ipv6: false                # ipv6?
znc_ssl: true                  # Should ZNC expect connections over ssl?
znc_ssl_certfile: "{{ znc_config_root }}/znc.pem"   # If ssl is enabled, where is the PEM file? This is generated by the Ansible build.
znc_global_modules:                                 # Which global modules should be installed for use across all users and networks?  Note that these are separate from user and network modules defined below.

### ZNC User Definition Configuration
```
znc_users:                                # It's advisable to have a separate admin user with no networks, for administering the ZNC server directly.  Here we just have the one user, for brevity.
  - name: admin
    password:                             # These can be generated with `znc --makepass`.  This one is for password "admin".
